// What will the following code output?

let str1 = "hello there";
let str2 = str1;
str2 = "goodbye!";
console.log(str1);
// Try to answer without running the code.

// hello there
// The output is hello there since we are dealing with strings. In JavaScript, strings are immutable and can't be changed. That also means that JavaScript passes them by value, that is, it passes a copy of the string. Thus, line 2 assigns str2 a new string that happens to be a copy of str1. Line 3, in turn, assigns str2 an entirely new string.
