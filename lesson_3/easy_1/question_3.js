// Question 3
// Determine whether the following object of people and their age contains an entry for 'Spot':

let ages = { Herman: 32, Lily: 30, Grandpa: 402, Eddie: 10 };

// Note that our keys have capitalized names; this usually violates style guidelines, but is fine for our purposes. We'll use such keys in several exercises in this course.

//console.log(Object.keys(ages));
//console.log(ages.hasOwnProperty('Herman'));
console.log(ages.hasOwnProperty('Spot'));
